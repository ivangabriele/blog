[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is by far the easiest-to-use static website generator, along with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) and [Hyde](http://hyde.github.io) if you prefer Python. It's not a secret that Github is one of the locomotives tracting the Ruby community and they didn't choose Jekyll as their [Github Pages generator](https://pages.github.com) out of the blue: it is crazy fast and highly reliable.

As a nice-to-have feature, you have pretty professional templates available for free and I try to save you some research type by listing 8 of them here.

For your information, if you are interested in going further with Jekyll, I suggest you also take a look at [Poole](http://getpoole.com), which is a Jekyll « overlay », but not in a negative sense.

All the themes presented here are responsive. And, so you know, this very blog [run on Jekyll](https://github.com/ivangabriele/blog).
