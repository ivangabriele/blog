You may wonder why I am writting about a subject like this one despite always repeating that *« The abrupt truth about Bitcoin is that, if its value was not sharply growing as it does, a lot less people would care about it. »* <sup>[1](https://twitter.com/ivan_gabriele/status/937665790622433280)</sup>. In short : yes, definetely yes, right now, most people trade Bitcoins and cryptocurrencies out of speculation.

However, unlike stock exchange trading, it doesn't impact the real economy and does not destroy jobs. At least not yet. So until it does, I also *played* this card, mostly to earn a certain financial freedom allowing me to launch [Coinboard](https://coinboard.us) project and some others that I will explain all in good time.

That being said, I started trading in August 2017 and had to struggle with most mistakes that crypto-traders do when they begin. These mistakes include getting ripped off by some exchanges because of their extortionate fees. So here is a bit of experience sharing.

## Coinbase: the best UX, but only 4 coins with really high fees

I started trading in August 2017 and first used [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) which is clearly the most famous, fancy and [fast-growing](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/coinbase-raises-100m-at-a-1-6b-valuation-amid-explosive-growth/) San Francisco crypto-startup.

Most traders you will met, who started trading in 2017 and are from a Western country, will tell you that they bought their first Bitcoins, Ethereums or Litecoins on Coinbase. Why ? Because the design is really friendly and makes you feel [deservedly safe](https://www.futureofeverything.io/2017/11/28/coinbase-safe/).

## Conclusion

My empirical advice can be summed up in three bullets :

1. Buy your first Bitcoins or Litecoins on **[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)**,<br>
wiring your fiat currency via a bank transfer.
2. Transfer these crypto-currencies to **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=10265687)**<br>
and trade between crypto-currencies on **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=10265687)**.
3. When you want widhdraw your fiat earnings, transfer your Bitcoins or Litecoins to **[Kraken](https://www.kraken.com)**<br>, sell them there and ask for a wire to your bank account.

Litecoin transaction (thus "transfer") fees are way lower than Bitcoin ones, and they are also way faster. I then recommand using Litecoin to transfer your funds between [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com) and [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=10265687).
